## About the transition

Vercel transitioned all Vercel Postgres stores to Neon's native integration (Q4 2024 - Q1 2025). Instead of managing Postgres directly, Vercel now offers database integrations through the [Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/marketplace), giving users more storage options and features.

   **Note** Terminology change: In Neon, a "Database" in Vercel is called a "Project." Everything else works the same.

---

## What changed for you

### Access and management

- **Same login**: Access your databases from both Vercel's **Storage** tab and the Neon Console
- **New management options**: Click **Open in Neon** to access advanced database features
- **Unified billing**: Everything remains billed through Vercel (no separate Neon billing)

### Automatic plan transitions

- **Hobby Plan users** → Neon Free plan (better limits, more features)
- **Pro Plan users** → Maintained existing limits with option to upgrade to Neon plans

## Billing and plans

### Plan comparison

| Plan Transition  | Compute Hours | Storage         | Databases | Key Changes                 |
| :--------------- | :------------ | :-------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------- |
| **Hobby → Free** | 60 → 190      | 256 MB → 512 MB | 1 → 10    | Significant improvements    |
| **Pro → Legacy** | 100 (same)    | 256 MB (same)   | 1 (same)  | No change until you upgrade |

### Cost comparison (Pro Plan)

| Resource                 | Vercel Pro | Neon Launch ($19/mo)   |
| :----------------------- | :--------- | :--------------------- |
| **Included compute**     | 100 hours  | 300 hours              |
| **Included storage**     | 256 MB     | 10 GB                  |
| **Extra compute**        | $0.10/hour | $0.16/hour             |
| **Extra storage**        | $0.12/GB   | $1.75/GB (after 10 GB) |
| **Data transfer**        | $0.10/GB   | Free                   |
| **Additional databases** | $1.00 each | Free (up to 100)       |

   **Tip** Upgrade to unlock features: Pro Plan users can stay on legacy limits or upgrade to a Neon plan to access branching, instant restore, and higher limits. [See how to upgrade](guides-vercel-managed-integration.md#changing-your-plan).

### Enterprise customers

Neon is working with the Vercel team to transition Enterprise customers. If you want to speak to us about an Enterprise-level Neon plan, you can [get in touch with our sales team](https://neon.com/contact-sales).
